# Agenda

## Abstract

Reconnaissance is about gathering information. The information gathered is only as good as the insights and actionable decisions that we can gain from it. A lot of research is focused on finding OSINT data but little is done towards converting the data into insights and actionable decisions. Visualisation is an easy and efficient way to gain insights from any of the data gleaned.

In this workshop, we will look at how we can gather OSINT data and visualise it using free and open source solutions. Visualising data is not enough, we'll also look at how we can use the metrics to answer business questions and lead to actionable decisions.

## Scenarios we will be covering in the workshop include

* Monitoring an organisation's SSL/TLS certificates, domains and subdomains (in near-real time)
* Creating dashboards using public datasets (to gain insights into an organisation's external posture)
* Building monitoring and alerting solutions (using OSINT data that will help us take business decisions)
